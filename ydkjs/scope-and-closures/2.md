# Lexical Scope

SCOPE is the set of rules that govern how the engine can look up a variable by its identifier name, in current Scope or any Nested SCopes

Two models for how scope works

LEXICAL SCOPE: used by most programming languages

DYNAMIC SCOPE: used by some languages, like bash scripting or some Perl modes

## Lex Time

The first traditional phase of compiling is the lexing/tokenizing. This is where you examine a string of source code characters and assign semantic meaning to the tokens as a result of some stateful parsing.

LEXICAL SCOPE is scope defined at lexing time. Based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored by you at write time, and thus is (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.

think about them as bubbles within each other


Scope lookups stops once it finds the first match.

Note: global variables are automatically properties of the global object, so its possible reference aglobal not directly by its name but by a property reference


you can cheat lexical scope with
- eval
- with

dont use them

eval with strict mode creates its own lexical scope

code runs slower because the engine cant do optimizations

### RECAP

lexical scope means scope is defined by author time decisions of where functions are declared

two ways to cheat lexical scope : eval and with

dont do them because EGNINE cant perform compile-time optimizations regarding scope-lookup, beacuse engine ahs to assume those will be invalid. code will be slower
